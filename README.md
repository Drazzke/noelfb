Hey it's my website at http://noelfb.com!
(or will be, soon)

## todo
 - probably should make article content stored in separate files that's loaded by JS automatically when you select it (instead of pre-loaded in the index.html)
 - need to fill out the rest of the portfolio content
 - then it's done???
